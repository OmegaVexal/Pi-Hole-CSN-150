# Pi-Hole-CSN-150
Steps on how to set up a Raspberry Pi into an Ad-Blocker known as a Pi-hole
First you will need a rasberry pi, any will work.
You will also need a micro-sd card, sd card reader,micro usb or usb-c cable if you have a Pi4 and onwards.
Once you have all your gear head on to <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/> and download the Rasberry Pi imager, make sure to download the apropriate imager for your OS. Another way to install the imager is inputting <sudo apt install rpi-imager> on the terminal window.
Once your imager is downloaded open it as administrator, Insert your SD-CARD reader into your computer device and wait for it to load
On the imager click on "Choose OS" click on Rasberry Pi OS(other) and select Rasberry Pi OS Lite 32-bit
After you chose the OS, Click on storage device and make sure you pick the inserted SD-card
On the bottom right there will be a  "Settings Wheel" click on it and name your Rasberrypi, Enable SSH, and give it a username and password.( Make sure to remember your user name and password I suggest you take a picture of this page incase you forget.)
Once all options are selected click on "Write" and let the imager do it's thing.
Once the imager completes writing on to the card you want to update the "WSL" file
